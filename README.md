# Board Games Analysis

Exploratory and statistical analysis of a Kaggle dataset containing the top 2,000 highest-rated board games. This project investigates factors that influence board game rankings using principal component analysis (PCA) and linear regression in R.

The Kaggle dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/chik0di/board-games-dataset-complete-features/data), and contains data scraped from BoardGameGeek (BGG), the largest board game database and community.

The analysis is presented in a quarto document, and the rendered file is hosted through GitHub Pages:
